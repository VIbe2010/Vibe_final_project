## Vibe
    An Android app 
    `All Documentation of the Project including proposal, SRS and SDS 
    can be found at  https://github.com/VIbe2010/SE-Documentation`


## Over view of the application


`The application has two types of users. Individuals are the first users and places are the second ones. Users should create a profile and signup prior to using the app. It acquires the users’ felling/mood as an input then it provides different kinds of suggestions based on the user’s (individual users) mood. It should also give users an opportunity to give their feedback about the places they have visited and also can report a spam if they have not found the given place at the given location. Places will be permitted to register as a service provider. The service suppliers will make available their location, the services they give and the kind of mood they believe they can fix. `
